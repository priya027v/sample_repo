Day 26

Source Code (Input) -----> Build Tool -----> Executable files (Output)

Using build tool we convert the source code into executable files.

C,C++ ---> make ---> .exe
Java  ---> maven/nodeJS/Gradle/SBT ---> .jar/.war/.ear
Python ---> python ---> .whl
.NET -----> .NET compiler ----> .dll

compiler for C => gcc
compiler for C++ => g++
compiler for java => javac

.jar => java archive
.war => web based archive (most widely used)
.ear => enterprise based archive

Build
It is a binary or executable file or artifact before testing

Release
Release is a tested build which is ready for release to the customers

Sanity/BVT(Build Verification Test)
It is a basic functionality of a build that should never break

Hotfix/Patch Build
It is a critical fix which needs to be delivered to the customer within few hours. If we modified 5 files among 1000 files, only 5 files will be compiled and regenerates the build. It takes less time

Load Build
We compile the source code from scratch to generate the build. It takes more time.

Release Note
It consists of two things
1) tag name
2) known issues
Devops engineer will prepare release notes.


IMPORTANT
What kind of issues(build issues) you faced while building the application? 
Once the build was broken, we need to debug and identify why build is broken.
-> If it is compilation issue(Syntax error issues) we need to work with developers to resolve the issue.
-> If it is build environment issue, we need to debug and fix it. Environment issues maybe:
	1) Memory is full on the server
	2) CPU usage is high on the server
	3) Version mis-match issue
	4) Dependency issues
	5) Slave machine is not available in Jenkins


IMPORTANT
Deployment Process
(How do we do deployment?)
(Have you worked on releases?)
-> We support deployment to the QA, DEV, STAGE, PRODUCTION environment
-> We deploy .war file to the web-based server(Apache Tomcat)
-> We have written a shell script to deploy .war file automatically and scheduled this script using Jenkins job.
-> To deploy to the test environment we need manager approval. To deploy to the production environment, we need CAB(Change Advisory Board) or SRE(Site Reliability Engineer) approval.
-> Once in 15 days(i.e., Saturday Morning) we will deploy.
